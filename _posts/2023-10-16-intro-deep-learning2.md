### Description

Instructor: [Jasper Zhang](https://jasperzhang.com/)

This workshop, led by Biostatistics PhD student Jasper Zhang, will focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data analysis. Participants will engage in Python coding tasks, including image classification utilizing the Keras library. No prior experience is required; we will provide a line-by-line code explanation for a better understanding. The session will explore the application of deep learning in medical research, introduce strategies for working with diverse medical data types (including images, genomics data, and microbiome data), and offer guidelines for furthering deep learning skills.
