description: Meta-analysis, the pooling of evidence from independent sources, especially randomised controlled trials is now common in the medical research literature. Software advances have contributed to the widespread use of meta-analytic techniques.  In this workshop, we will show how meta-analysis models can be seen as generalized linear models. We will also see how to fit these models under a Bayesian perspective.
